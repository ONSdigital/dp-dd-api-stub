### Getting started

Make sure [govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor) is installed and
`GOPATH` and `GOROOT` environment variables are set correctly.

The command will create/update `data.go` 
using [go-bindata](https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata) based on the JSON files inside 
the `stub` directory. 

NOTE: there are still some handlers that have not been transformed to use stubbed JSON.
